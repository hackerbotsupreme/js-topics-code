// The return statement in JavaScript is used to specify the value that a function should return. It allows a function to compute a value and pass it back to the code that called the function. The return statement is optional, and its usage depends on the specific scenario and requirements of your code. Here are some scenarios where you would typically use the return statement in a function:

// Returning a computed value: Functions often perform computations or transformations on input data and return the result. The return statement is used to provide the computed value as the output of the function. For example:

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

const sum = add(3, 4); // Returns 7
console.log(sum); // Output: 7
// Terminating the function early: Sometimes, you may have conditional logic within a function, and you want to exit the function prematurely under certain conditions. The return statement can be used to immediately terminate the function and return a value. For example:

function divide(a, b) {
  if (b === 0) {
    return 'Cannot divide by zero.';
  }

  return a / b;
}

const result1 = divide(10, 2); // Returns 5
console.log(result1); // Output: 5

const result2 = divide(10, 0); // Returns 'Cannot divide by zero.'
console.log(result2); // Output: 'Cannot divide by zero.'

// Returning multiple values: In JavaScript, a function can only return a single value. However, you can use an array, object, or other data structures to return multiple values as a single entity. For example:

function getCoordinates() {
  const x = 10;
  const y = 20;

  return [x, y];
}

const [x, y] = getCoordinates();
console.log(x, y); // Output: 10 20
// Returning early in a loop: When working with loops, you may encounter scenarios where you want to exit the loop and return a value based on certain conditions. The return statement can be used to break out of the loop and terminate the function. For example:

function findFirstNegative(numbers) {
  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    if (numbers[i] < 0) {
      return numbers[i]; // Return the first negative number found
    }
  }

  return 'No negative numbers found.';
}

const array1 = [1, 2, -3, 4, -5];
const result3 = findFirstNegative(array1); // Returns -3
console.log(result1); // Output: -3

const array2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const result4 = findFirstNegative(array2); // Returns 'No negative numbers found.'
console.log(result2); // Output: 'No negative numbers found.'
// These are just a few examples of scenarios where the return statement is commonly used. The decision to use a return statement in a function depends on the specific requirements and logic of your code.

// i dont understand console.timeEnd  function . teach me how its work and how to use it 

// Certainly! The console.timeEnd() function is used to stop a timer that was started using console.time(). It measures the amount of time elapsed between the console.time() and console.timeEnd() calls and logs the duration to the console. Let's dive into how it works and how to use it:

// Syntax: console.timeEnd(label)

// label: A string label that identifies the timer. It should match the label used in console.time().
// The console.time() function:

// It starts a new timer with a given label.
// The label is used to identify the timer and should be unique.
// The console.timeEnd() function:

// It stops the timer associated with the given label.
// It calculates the duration between the console.time() and console.timeEnd() calls.
// It logs the duration to the console along with the label.
// Here's an example to illustrate how to use console.time() and console.timeEnd():

console.time('myTimer');

// Perform some time-consuming operations
for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
  // Some calculations
}

console.timeEnd('myTimer');
// In this example:

// We start a timer labeled 'myTimer' using console.time('myTimer').
// We perform some time-consuming operations inside the loop.
// After the operations are complete, we stop the timer using console.timeEnd('myTimer').
// The console.timeEnd() function calculates the duration of the operations and logs it to the console along with the label 'myTimer'.
// When you run this code, you will see the duration of the time-consuming operations logged to the console, like this: 'myTimer: 21.556ms'.

// The console.time() and console.timeEnd() functions are useful for measuring the performance of different parts of your code. They can help you identify bottlenecks and optimize your code. By labeling multiple timers and comparing their durations, you can gain insights into the efficiency of different sections of your code.

// i dont understand console.time  function . teach me how its work and how to use it 
// Certainly! The console.time() function is used to start a timer that can be used to measure the duration of an operation. It allows you to track the execution time of a specific code block or function. Let's dive into how it works and how to use it:

// The console.time() and console.timeEnd() functions are useful for measuring the performance of different parts of your code. By placing console.time() at the start of a code block or function, and console.timeEnd() at the end, you can measure the elapsed time it takes for that specific portion of your code to execute. This can help you identify performance bottlenecks and optimize your code.

// CONSOLE methods(15)
// purpose/use 
// These are some of the commonly used console methods in JavaScript. The console methods are primarily(প্রাথমিকভাবে) used for debugging and logging purposes, allowing developers to inspect variables, track code execution, and identify and fix issues in their JavaScript code. The exact set of available console methods may vary slightly between different browser environments.

// JavaScript provides several console methods that allow you to interact with the browser's console and output messages, debug information, and other useful data. Here are some commonly used console methods in JavaScript:

// 1.log(message1, message2, ..., messageN): Outputs a message or a list of messages to the console.
    // main purposes of using console.log():
    // Debugging: By logging relevant information to the console, such as variable values, function outputs, or intermediate results, you can analyze and understand the behavior of your code. It helps you identify and fix issues, track the flow of your program, and verify the correctness of your logic.
    // Inspecting Objects: You can log objects to the console to inspect their properties and values. This is particularly useful when working with complex data structures or when you want to check the current state of an object.
    // Testing and Verification: console.log() allows you to validate the output of certain operations or test specific parts of your code. By logging the expected values or intermediate results, you can compare them with the actual output and ensure that your code is functioning as expected.
    // Logging Information: You can use console.log() to display informative messages, warnings, or error notifications to provide feedback or information to developers or users.
    const Name = 'John';
    console.log('Hello, ' + Name); // Output: Hello, John
    const num1 = 5;
    const num2 = 10;
    const sum1 = num1 + num2;
    console.log('The sum of', num1, 'and', num2, 'is', sum1); // Output: The sum of 5 and 10 is 15

// 2.error(message1, message2, ..., messageN): Outputs an error message or a list of error messages to the console.
    // One practical real case where the Error object in JavaScript is commonly used is for handling and reporting errors in code.

    // For example, let's say you are building a web application that processes user input, and you want to handle potential errors when validating the input data.

    // Here's an example:

    function validateInput(input) {
      if (!input) {
        throw new Error("Input is required");
      }

      if (typeof input !== "string") {
        throw new Error("Input must be a string");
      }

      if (input.length < 5) {
        throw new Error("Input must be at least 5 characters long");
      }

      // Additional validation logic...

      return true;
    }

    try {
      var userInput = "abc";

      validateInput(userInput);

      // Continue with further processing if input is valid...

    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Input validation error:", error.message);
    }
    // In this case, the Error object is used to create custom error instances with specific error messages. The throw statement is used to raise an error when certain conditions are not met during the input validation process.

    // The try-catch statement is used to catch any thrown errors and handle them gracefully. If an error occurs during the input validation, the error object is caught in the catch block, and the error message is logged to the console or handled in a specific way.

    // The use of the Error object allows you to provide meaningful error messages and propagate information about the type and cause of the error, making it easier to identify and debug issues in your code.

    // Other practical applications of the Error object include handling exceptions, validating input parameters, reporting errors in asynchronous operations, and implementing error handling and logging mechanisms in various real-world applications such as web development, server-side programming, or building robust error reporting systems.
// ------------------------------------------
    // The purpose of the console.error() method in JavaScript is to output error messages to the console. It is specifically designed for logging and displaying error-related information during the development and debugging process. Here are two examples of the purpose and usage of console.error():

    // Error Logging: When an error occurs in your JavaScript code, you can use console.error() to log the details of the error, including the error message and stack trace. This helps you identify and debug errors more effectively. For example:
    try {
      // Some code that may throw an error
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("An error occurred:", error);
    }
    // In this example, if an error is thrown within the try block, it will be caught in the catch block, and the error details will be logged using console.error().

    // Error Notifications: In addition to logging errors to the console during development, you can also use console.error() to display error messages or notifications to users. For example, in a web application, you might want to show an error message on the UI when a specific condition is not met or when an operation fails. You can use console.error() along with other UI-related techniques to provide a visual indication of the error. For instance:
    if (someCondition) {
      console.error("Invalid input! Please provide a valid value.");
      // Show an error message on the UI
    }
    // }
    // In this example, if someCondition evaluates to true, an error message is logged using console.error(), and you can take further steps to display the error message on the UI.

    // It's worth mentioning that the console.error() method typically produces a distinct visual styling in the console output, such as highlighting the error message in red or displaying an error icon, making it easier to differentiate and identify errors from other console log messages
// 3.warn(message1, message2, ..., messageN): Outputs a warning message or a list of warning messages to the console.
    // The purpose of the console.warn() method in JavaScript is to output warning messages to the console. It is specifically used to highlight potential issues or warnings in the code or application. Here are two examples of the purpose and usage of console.warn():

    // Deprecation Warning: When a certain feature or functionality in your codebase is deprecated or will be removed in future versions, you can use console.warn() to alert developers about it. This helps them identify and update the code to avoid using deprecated features. For example:
    function oldFunction() {
      console.warn("Warning: 'oldFunction' is deprecated. Use 'newFunction' instead.");
      // Logic for the old function
    }

    // In this example, when the oldFunction is called, a warning message is logged using console.warn() to inform developers that the function is deprecated and should be replaced with newFunction.

    // Potential Issues or Mistakes: During development or debugging, you can use console.warn() to highlight potential issues or mistakes that may not cause errors but need attention. For instance, if you detect a possible performance bottleneck, usage of a deprecated method, or a potential logical error, you can log a warning message using console.warn() to draw attention to it. Here's an example:
    function processArray(arr) {
      if (arr.length > 1000) {
        console.warn("Warning: The input array is very large. Consider optimizing the code.");
      }
      // Code logic for processing the array
    }

    // In this example, if the input array passed to processArray has a length greater than 1000, a warning message is logged using console.warn(). This helps developers identify and optimize the code if processing such a large array might have performance implications.

    // The console.warn() method typically produces a distinct visual styling in the console output, such as highlighting the warning message in yellow or displaying a warning icon, making it easier to differentiate and identify warnings from other console log messages.
        // -------------------------------
        // The warn() function in JavaScript is commonly used in practical real cases for logging warning messages to the console. It is often used to provide developers with non-critical information or potential issues in the code.

        // One such practical case is during the development and debugging phase of a web application, where you want to alert developers about certain conditions or behaviors that might cause unexpected results but are not critical errors.
        
        // Here's an example:
        
        function calculateAverage(numbers) {
          if (!Array.isArray(numbers)) {
            console.warn("Expected an array of numbers for the calculateAverage function.");
          }
        
          // Calculate the average...
        }
        
        var scores = [85, 90, 95, 80];
        calculateAverage(scores);
        
        var invalidInput = "Not an array";
        calculateAverage(invalidInput);
        // In this example, the calculateAverage() function calculates the average of a given array of numbers. Before performing the calculation, a check is made using the Array.isArray() method to ensure that the input parameter numbers is an array. If it's not an array, a warning message is logged to the console using console.warn().
        
        // During development, if the calculateAverage() function is called with an invalid input, such as a string, the warning message will be displayed in the console:
        
        
        // Expected an array of numbers for the calculateAverage function.
        // By using console.warn(), developers can be alerted to potential issues, non-standard usage, or areas of the code that require attention without disrupting the execution of the program.
        
        // Other practical applications of console.warn() include logging warnings related to deprecated methods, alerting about potential performance bottlenecks, logging fallback behaviors, or providing additional information for debugging purposes in various real-world applications such as web development, debugging complex algorithms, or monitoring code execution.
// 4.info(message1, message2, ..., messageN): Outputs an informational message or a list of informational messages to the console.
    // The purpose of the console.info() method in JavaScript is to provide informational messages or details to the console. It is commonly used to output informative logs or communicate specific information during development or debugging. Here are two examples of the purpose and usage of console.info():

    // Debugging Information: When troubleshooting or debugging code, you can use console.info() to output relevant details or information about certain variables, states, or program flow. This helps in understanding the behavior of the code and diagnosing issues. For example:
    let username = "John";
    let age = 25;
    console.info("User Information:");
    console.info("Username:", username);
    console.info("Age:", age);

    // In this example, console.info() is used to output the user's information, including their username and age. This helps in debugging by displaying the values of variables and providing context about the user.

    // Progress Updates: During the execution of a long-running process or asynchronous operation, you can use console.info() to provide progress updates or milestones. This allows you to track the progress of the operation and provide real-time information to developers. For instance:
    function processBatchData(batch) {
      console.info("Processing batch data...");
      // Logic for processing the batch data
      console.info("Batch processing completed.");
    }
    // In this example, console.info() is used to indicate the start and completion of the batch data processing. It helps developers understand the progress of the operation and provides feedback during its execution.

    // The console.info() method typically produces console output with a distinctive styling, such as informational icons or specific formatting, depending on the console environment. This helps differentiate informational messages from other types of console log outputs and makes it easier to identify and distinguish them.
    // -------------------------------
    // The info() function you mentioned, specifically console.info(), is not a built-in function in JavaScript. However, in many JavaScript environments, including web browsers, you can use console.info() as an alternative to console.log() for logging informational messages to the console.

    // One practical real case where console.info() (or console.log()) is commonly used is for providing developers with informational messages or tracking the flow of execution during development and debugging.
    
    // Here's an example:
    
    function fetchData() {
      console.info("Fetching data from the server...");
    
      // Perform the data fetching logic...
    
      console.info("Data fetching complete.");
    }
    
    fetchData();
    // In this example, the console.info() statements are used to log informational messages during the execution of the fetchData() function. The first message indicates that data is being fetched from the server, and the second message indicates that the data fetching process is complete.
    
    // Using console.info() allows developers to provide additional context or track the progress of certain operations during the runtime of the application.
    
    // The console.info() function is typically used for logging non-critical, informative messages, as it is similar to console.log() but often treated as a distinct log level. However, it's important to note that the behavior and appearance of the console output can vary depending on the environment and the developer tools being used.
    
    // Other practical applications of console.info() (or console.log()) include logging debug information, outputting diagnostic details, documenting code behavior, tracking program flow, or providing additional information during development and debugging in various real-world applications such as web development, server-side programming, or building complex software systems.
    
    
    
    
    
//5. clear(): Clears the console.
    // The purpose of the console.clear() method in JavaScript is to clear the console output, removing any previously logged messages or content. It allows you to start with a clean console, making it useful in different scenarios. Here are two examples of the purpose and usage of console.clear():

    // Clearing Debugging Output: When debugging or analyzing code, you may have a significant amount of console output from various console.log() or console.error() statements. In such cases, using console.clear() helps you clear the console and remove the previous log entries. This provides a clean slate for new debugging information and allows you to focus on the most recent output. For example:
    // // Debugging statements
    console.log("Debugging message 1");
    console.log("Debugging message 2");
    console.log("Debugging message 3");

    // Clear the console
    console.clear();

    // New debugging statements
    console.log("New debugging message 1");
    console.log("New debugging message 2");

    // In this example, console.clear() is used to clear the console after the initial debugging statements. It ensures that only the new debugging messages are visible, making it easier to focus on the current debugging session.

    // Hiding Sensitive Information: Sometimes, you may have logged sensitive information, such as API keys or passwords, in the console during development or testing. To prevent this information from being visible in subsequent console sessions or to protect it from being accidentally logged, you can use console.clear() to clear the console and remove any traces of the sensitive data. For instance:
    // Sensitive information
    const apiKey = "abcdef123456";
    console.log("API Key:", apiKey);

    // Clear the console
    console.clear();

    // Proceed with other code
    // ...
    // In this example, console.clear() is used to clear the console after logging the API key. This helps protect the sensitive information from being visible to other developers or when sharing the code.

    // Note that console.clear() clears the console output in the current environment where the code is executed. Different console environments, such as the browser console or Node.js console, may have variations in how console.clear() behaves or the extent to which it clears the console history.
//6. assert(assertion, message): Writes an error message to the console if the assertion is false.
    // The purpose of the console.assert() method in JavaScript is to log an error message to the console if an assertion condition is false. It helps with debugging and identifying issues by providing a way to assert or check certain conditions in your code. Here are two examples of the purpose and usage of console.assert():

    // Testing Pre-Conditions: When writing code that relies on certain conditions being true, you can use console.assert() to validate those conditions during development or testing. If the condition is false, an error message will be logged to the console. For example:
    function divide(a, b) {
      console.assert(b !== 0, "Divisor cannot be zero");
      return a / b;
    }

    console.log(divide(10, 2)); // Output: 5
    console.log(divide(10, 0)); // Assertion error: Divisor cannot be zero

    // In this example, console.assert() is used to check the pre-condition that the divisor (b) should not be zero. If the condition is false, the error message "Divisor cannot be zero" is logged to the console. This helps catch potential issues early during development or testing.

    // Debugging Unexpected Behavior: You can also use console.assert() to validate assumptions or expectations in your code and log an error message if those assumptions are not met. This can help in debugging and identifying unexpected behavior. For example:
    function processUser(user) {
      console.assert(user.name, "User name is required");
      console.assert(user.age >= 18, "User must be an adult");

      // Process user data
    }

    const user1 = { name: "John", age: 25 };
    const user2 = { age: 16 };

    // processUser(user1); // No assertion errors
    // processUser(user2); // Assertion error: User name is required
    // In this example, console.assert() is used to assert that certain properties (name and age) exist on the user object and meet specific criteria. If any of the assertions fail, an error message is logged to the console. This helps identify missing or invalid data that could lead to unexpected behavior.

    // The console.assert() method is a helpful tool for adding runtime assertions in your code. It allows you to explicitly check conditions and ensure that your code meets certain expectations. If an assertion fails, an error message is logged, making it easier to identify and resolve issues during development or debugging.
        // -------------------------------
        // The assert() function in JavaScript is commonly used for debugging and testing purposes to assert that certain conditions are met. It allows you to specify conditions that must be true and throws an error if the condition is false.
        // One practical real case where assert() is used is in unit testing to verify the expected behavior of functions or modules.
        
        // Here's an example:
        
        function add(a, b) {
          assert(typeof a === 'number' && typeof b === 'number', 'Parameters must be numbers');
          return a + b;
        }
        
        // Unit test
        assert(add(2, 3) === 5, 'Addition failed');
        // In this example, the assert() function is used to validate that the parameters passed to the add() function are numbers. If the assertion fails (the condition is false), an error is thrown with the provided error message.
        
        // During unit testing, assertions are used to validate that functions or modules behave as expected. If the assertion fails, it indicates a problem in the code.
        
        // The assert() function helps catch errors early in the development process and provides a mechanism to verify assumptions about the code's behavior.
        
        // While assert() is often used during development and testing, it's important to note that it is typically disabled in production environments for performance reasons. Therefore, it's primarily used as a debugging and testing tool.
        
        // Other practical applications of assert() include enforcing preconditions and postconditions, validating function outputs, asserting invariants, or checking for unexpected behavior during development, debugging, and testing in various real-world applications such as software testing frameworks, automated testing tools, or debugging complex algorithms.
// 7.dir(object): Displays an interactive list of the properties of the specified JavaScript object.
    // The purpose of the console.dir() method in JavaScript is to display an interactive list of the properties of a specified JavaScript object in the console. It provides a detailed representation of the object's properties, including inherited properties, and allows you to explore and inspect the object's structure. Here are two examples of the purpose and usage of console.dir():

    // Inspecting an Object: console.dir() is commonly used to inspect the properties and structure of an object. It provides a tree-like representation of the object's properties, making it easier to navigate and understand its structure. For example:
    const person = {
      name: "John Doe",
      age: 30,
      address: {
        street: "123 Main St",
        city: "New York",
        country: "USA"
      }
    };

    console.dir(person);

    // In this example, console.dir() is used to display the properties and structure of the person object. It shows the nested address object and its properties, allowing you to explore the object's structure directly in the console.

    // Inspecting DOM Elements: console.dir() is also useful for inspecting DOM elements and their properties. You can pass a DOM element to console.dir() to see its properties, methods, and other relevant information. For example:
    // const element = document.getElementById("myElement");
    // console.dir(element);
    // In this example, console.dir() is used to inspect the properties and methods of a DOM element with the ID "myElement". It displays a detailed representation of the element, including its attributes, styles, event listeners, and more.

    // By using console.dir(), you can explore the properties and structure of JavaScript objects and DOM elements in a more detailed and interactive way. It helps with debugging, understanding object hierarchies, and gaining insights into the available properties and methods of an object.
        // -------------------------------
        // The dir() function, specifically console.dir(), is commonly used in JavaScript for logging objects to the console in a more detailed and interactive format. It displays the properties and methods of an object in a hierarchical tree-like structure, allowing developers to inspect the object's structure and explore its contents.
        // One practical real case where console.dir() is used is during the development and debugging phase of a web application when you want to explore and understand the structure of complex objects or data.
         // In this example, the console.dir() function is used to log the person object to the console. The output will display the object's properties, their values, and their nested structures in a tree-like format.
        
        // The use of console.dir() allows you to easily inspect and navigate through the properties and nested objects of complex data structures, helping you gain insights into their composition and identify any issues or inconsistencies.
        
        // Other practical applications of console.dir() include examining the properties and methods of built-in JavaScript objects, exploring the structure of API responses, inspecting the DOM structure of web pages, or debugging complex data structures and objects in various real-world applications such as web development, server-side programming, or data analysis.
        // Here's an example:
        
        var person = {
          name: "John",
          age: 30,
          address: {
            street: "123 Main St",           //complex objects or data

// 8. group(label): Creates a new inline group in the console.
    // The purpose of the console.group() method in JavaScript is to group log messages together in a collapsible group in the console, making it easier to organize and navigate the logged output. It allows you to group related log messages and visually separate them from other logs. Here are two examples of the purpose and usage of console.group():

    // Grouping Related Logs: console.group() is commonly used to group and organize related log messages. For example, if you have multiple log statements that are related to a specific task or section of your code, you can group them together using console.group(). This provides a visual hierarchy in the console output and helps in understanding the relationship between the logs. 
    // In this example, the console.group() method is used to create a group titled "calculateSum". The related log statements are then placed inside the group using console.log(). By using console.groupEnd() at the end, the group is closed, and the logs following it will appear outside the group.

    // Nested Groups: console.group() can be nested to create a hierarchical structure for organizing logs. This is useful when you have multiple levels of related logs.

    
    // In this example, the console.group() method is used to create a group titled "performComplexTask". Inside that group, two nested groups titled "Subtask 1" and "Subtask 2" are created. The relevant log statements are placed inside each group. The nested groups provide a clear hierarchical structure for organizing the logs.

    // By using console.group(), you can visually group and organize your logs, making it easier to navigate and understand the console output, especially when dealing with complex or nested log messages.

    // Here's an example:
    function calculateSum(a, b) {
      console.group("calculateSum");
      console.log("Calculating the sum of two numbers...");
      console.log(`Numbers: ${a}, ${b}`);
      const sum = a + b;
      console.log(`Sum: ${sum}`);
      console.groupEnd();
      return sum;
    }

    calculateSum(5, 10);
    // In this example, the console.group() method is used to create a group titled "calculateSum". The related log statements are then placed inside the group using console.log(). By using console.groupEnd() at the end, the group is closed, and the logs following it will appear outside the group.

    // Nested Groups: console.group() can be nested to create a hierarchical structure for organizing logs. This is useful when you have multiple levels of related logs. Here's an example:

    function performComplexTask() {
      console.group("performComplexTask");
      console.log("Executing complex task...");
      console.group("Subtask 1");
      console.log("Executing subtask 1...");
      console.groupEnd();
      console.group("Subtask 2");
      console.log("Executing subtask 2...");
      console.groupEnd();
      console.groupEnd();
    }

    performComplexTask();

    // In this example, the console.group() method is used to create a group titled "performComplexTask". Inside that group, two nested groups titled "Subtask 1" and "Subtask 2" are created. The relevant log statements are placed inside each group. The nested groups provide a clear hierarchical structure for organizing the logs.

    // By using console.group(), you can visually group and organize your logs, making it easier to navigate and understand the console output, especially when dealing with complex or nested log messages.

    // -------------------------------

    // In JavaScript, there is no built-in group() function. However, if you are referring to grouping data based on a specific criterion, you can achieve that using custom logic.

    // Here's a practical real case where data grouping can be useful:
    // Let's say you have an array of objects representing products, and you want to group them based on their category.
    // To group the products based on their category, you can create a function that iterates over the array and builds a new object where the keys represent the categories and the values are arrays of products in each category.
    // The groupByCategory() function iterates over the products array and dynamically creates properties in the groupedData object based on the unique categories found. It then pushes each product into the corresponding category array.
    // This grouping of products based on their category can be useful for various purposes, such as generating reports, filtering and displaying products by category, or performing further analysis on specific product categories.
    
    // By leveraging custom logic and data manipulation techniques, you can group data in JavaScript based on specific criteria to facilitate data processing and analysis in various real-world applications.


    var products = [
      { name: "iPhone", category: "Electronics" },
      { name: "Laptop", category: "Electronics" },
      { name: "Shirt", category: "Clothing" },
      { name: "Shoes", category: "Clothing" },
      { name: "Book", category: "Books" },
      { name: "Headphones", category: "Electronics" }
    ];
    // To group the products based on their category, you can create a function that iterates over the array and builds a new object where the keys represent the categories and the values are arrays of products in each category.
    
    function groupByCategory(products) {
      var groupedData = {};
    
      products.forEach(function(product) {
        var category = product.category;
    
        if (!groupedData[category]) {
          groupedData[category] = [];
        }
    
        groupedData[category].push(product);
      });
    
      return groupedData;
    }
    
    var groupedProducts = groupByCategory(products);
    console.log(groupedProducts);
    // The groupByCategory() function iterates over the products array and dynamically creates properties in the groupedData object based on the unique categories found. It then pushes each product into the corresponding category array.
    
    // The resulting groupedProducts object will be:
    
    {
      Electronics: [
        { name: "iPhone", category: "Electronics" },
        { name: "Laptop", category: "Electronics" },
        { name: "Headphones", category: "Electronics" }
      ],
      Clothing; [
        { name: "Shirt", category: "Clothing" },
        { name: "Shoes", category: "Clothing" }
      ],
      Books; [
        { name: "Book", category: "Books" }
      ]
    }
    // This grouping of products based on their category can be useful for various purposes, such as generating reports, filtering and displaying products by category, or performing further analysis on specific product categories.
    
    // By leveraging custom logic and data manipulation techniques, you can group data in JavaScript based on specific criteria to facilitate data processing and analysis in various real-world applications.


// 9.groupCollapsed(label): Creates a new inline group in the console, initially collapsed.
    // I apologize for the confusion, but the console.groupCollapsed() method does not exist in JavaScript. However, there is a similar method called console.groupCollapsed() which serves the same purpose as console.group(), but with the difference that the group is initially collapsed in the console, requiring the user to manually expand it to view the log messages.

    // Here are two examples of using console.groupCollapsed():

    // Grouping Detailed Log Messages: Let's say you have a function that performs a complex operation with multiple steps, and you want to log detailed information about each step. Instead of having all the log messages expanded by default, you can use console.groupCollapsed() to collapse the group initially, providing a high-level overview of the logs.

    // In this example, the console.groupCollapsed() method is used to create collapsed groups for each step of the complex task. The detailed log messages within each group will be hidden initially, allowing you to get an overview of the steps without cluttering the console.

    // Nested Collapsed Groups: Just like console.group(), console.groupCollapsed() can also be nested to create a hierarchical structure of collapsed groups. This is useful when you have multiple levels of related logs that you want to collapse initially.

     // In this example, the outer group is collapsed initially, and within it, two inner groups are also collapsed. The console will show a collapsed summary of the groups, allowing you to expand them individually to view the log messages.

    // Using console.groupCollapsed() can help you organize and present detailed logs in a more compact and manageable way. It provides an overview of the log structure while allowing you to expand specific groups for more detailed information when needed.


    // Here's an example:
    function performComplexTask() {
      console.groupCollapsed("performComplexTask");
      
      console.groupCollapsed("Step 1");
      console.log("Performing step 1...");
      console.groupEnd();
      
      console.groupCollapsed("Step 2");
      console.log("Performing step 2...");
      console.groupEnd();
      
      console.groupCollapsed("Step 3");
      console.log("Performing step 3...");
      console.groupEnd();
      
      console.groupEnd();
    }

    performComplexTask();

    // In this example, the console.groupCollapsed() method is used to create collapsed groups for each step of the complex task. The detailed log messages within each group will be hidden initially, allowing you to get an overview of the steps without cluttering the console.

    // Nested Collapsed Groups: Just like console.group(), console.groupCollapsed() can also be nested to create a hierarchical structure of collapsed groups. This is useful when you have multiple levels of related logs that you want to collapse initially. Here's an example:
    console.groupCollapsed("Outer Group");

    console.groupCollapsed("Inner Group 1");
    console.log("Inner Group 1 log message");
    console.groupEnd();

    console.groupCollapsed("Inner Group 2");
    console.log("Inner Group 2 log message");
    console.groupEnd();

    console.groupEnd();

    // In this example, the outer group is collapsed initially, and within it, two inner groups are also collapsed. The console will show a collapsed summary of the groups, allowing you to expand them individually to view the log messages.

    // Using console.groupCollapsed() can help you organize and present detailed logs in a more compact and manageable way. It provides an overview of the log structure while allowing you to expand specific groups for more detailed information when needed.
        // -------------------------------

    //The groupCollapsed() function in JavaScript is a console method that allows you to create collapsed groups in the console output. It is commonly used for organizing and presenting related log messages or data in a more structured and visually appealing manner.

    // One practical real case where console.groupCollapsed() is used is when logging detailed information or debugging complex processes with multiple steps or iterations.


    // In this example, the console.groupCollapsed() function is used to create a collapsed group titled "Processing Order" in the console output. Within the group, relevant information about the order is logged using console.log().

    // When you run the code, you will see a collapsed group in the console output. Clicking on the group will expand it to reveal the detailed information logged inside.

    // The use of console.groupCollapsed() helps in organizing and visually structuring log messages, especially when dealing with complex operations or large amounts of data. It allows developers to group related log statements together and selectively expand or collapse them as needed.

    // Other practical applications of console.groupCollapsed() include logging and organizing debug information during the execution of complex functions or algorithms, tracking the flow of program execution, visualizing hierarchical data structures, or presenting step-by-step processes in a more readable and organized manner during development and debugging in various real-world applications such as web development, server-side programming, or building complex software systems.


    // Here's an example:

// 10.groupEnd(): Exits the current inline group in the console. The correct method name is console.groupEnd() (without the extra space). The console.groupEnd() method is used to close the most recently opened group in the console.

    // Here are two examples of using console.groupEnd():

    // Closing Grouped Log Messages: When you use console.group() or console.groupCollapsed() to create a group of log messages, you can use console.groupEnd() to close the group. This is useful when you want to encapsulate a specific set of logs within a group. Here's an example:

     // In this example, the console.group() method is used to open a group labeled "Group 1". The subsequent console.log() calls are part of that group. Finally, console.groupEnd() is used to close the group. The last console.log() call is outside of the group and will be displayed separately in the console.

    // Closing Nested Groups: When you have nested groups using console.group() or console.groupCollapsed(), you can use console.groupEnd() to close each level of nesting. This allows you to structure and organize your logs in a hierarchical manner.


    console.group("Group 1");
    console.log("Log message 1");
    console.log("Log message 2");
    console.log("Log message 3");
    console.groupEnd();

    // Closing Nested Groups: When you have nested groups using console.group() or console.groupCollapsed(), you can use console.groupEnd() to close each level of nesting. This allows you to structure and organize your logs in a hierarchical manner.



    // In this example, there is an outer group and an inner group. The console.groupEnd() method is used twice to close the inner and outer groups respectively. The log messages within each group are grouped together visually in the console, making it easier to understand the structure of the logs.

    // Using console.groupEnd() is important to properly close groups created with console.group() or console.groupCollapsed(). It helps maintain the hierarchy and organization of log messages in the console.
